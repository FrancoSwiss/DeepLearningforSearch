# DeepLearningforSearch

The root of a search engineâ€™s value proposition is relevance. Relevance is the art of ranking content that satisfies the needs of the user. 

Traditional search engine models such as ElasticSearch use an inverted index based on tokenized words. 

In this paper, we will replace this traditional tokenization process with a neural network word embedding called Word2Vec (created by Tomas Mikolov at Google).

By adding semantic similarity, we can improve search relevance by up to X%. This can be particularly useful for document retrieval in highly specialized domains such as law or medicine
